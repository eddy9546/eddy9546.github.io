                <p>Baby and me is one of the many videos ad of Evian, as usual they use babies dancing, this time when the actors walks in front of a giant mirror they see the refection of them as a baby and unbelieving they start to dance.The purpose the advert  is to entertain the viewer and it does because it is very funny and i personally enjoyed watching it. </p>
                <p>Before the end of the advert is really difficult to understand what the ad is about, anyone watching the ad for the first time is going to ask why are people dancing in front of a giant mirror in the middle of a city. </p>
                <p>Baby and me is nothing new if you have watched Evian's other videos, this time the only difference is the adults dancing,The special effect used are amazing and the editing too. Overall is incredibly fun to watch.</p>

                  <p> Until Dawn review</p>
                  <p>Until Dawn is an interactive drama survival horror adventure video game published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 4.</p>
                  <p>The game is designed to be played multiple times, as players cannot see all content with a single play-through.  Each play through lasts about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize an in-game system called the "Butterfly Effect" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on.</p>
                  <p>The developer has stated that Until Dawn has "hundreds of endings"  Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings for each character.</p>
                  <p>The Bad:</p>
                  <p>Camera angles are unflattering, sometime you can not see your surroundings The Story gets predictable at its midpoint </p>
                   <p>The Good:</p>
                   <p>The narrative offers dozens of branching paths with varying outcomes
The choices you make matter in big ways and affect the rest of the game
The Actors performance are really good they made me care for the characters
Repeat playthroughs offers new information and scenes.</p>

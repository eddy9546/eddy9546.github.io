         <p class="p1"> For this assingment i was asked to design one Linear multimedia and one Interactive multimedia.<a href="E:\website\documents\Unit17.doc">click here to download the assignment</a></p>
            <h1 class="multi">Linear Design</h1>
            <p>The target audience for this video is everyone with a smartphone, pc or browser basic knowledge, there is no age limit or a minimum age, and I will say this app would be useful to those who travel a lot but other people can use it as well. </p>
            <p>The user requirement for this multimedia are any device with browser enable to surf the web and view the video, smartphone and tablets or any device that can view the video on it.
Adobe flash plug-in may be required to view the videos from older device. 
</p>
            <p>The purpose of the linear video is to persuade viewer to buy my app and use it. Showing some of the feature of the application in the video the viewers knows what the app can do and then he
                    I will be using text, screenplay of the app running, Graphic the app icon, video and audio.
                        I will record screen play of the app for the video highlighting the features and user interface
                             For the audio I will create a short sequence of sound using garage band a tool used to produce and edit music.
        </p>
<img src="E:\website\images\ldesign.jpg"" alt="Linear design" height="420" width="420">
        <p> The design screen is really simple there will be an audio playing on the background of the video, the first screen is the animated logo of the application followed by some screen showing some of the features of the app, the second screen shows the loading screen of the app, the third            screen shows the menu, the fourth screen displays the currency converter app which will show and how to use it and the log screen with some animation of data being entered, the last screen will be a page displaying the application name and where you can download it. The audio                    playing on the background will be created using Garageband a software used to create music. </p>
    <p> The hardware requirement to view this multimedia are any device with internet connection and flash plug in enable, basically if the can access YouTube they can view the video.
            The hardware and software requirement to create the video are a computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse
                </p>
            <h1 class="multi">Interactive Design</h1>
            <p> The audience for this interactive quiz are current and future computing class level 2 student. 
                </p>
                <p> The user requirement for the interactive design are a computer with power point installed or any software that enables them to open the file and interact with it.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of it is to help future student of level 2 computing prepare for the Unit 1&2 exams, or anyone who want to try out the quiz. The design will be simple question on the middle of the screen with the four answer under it two each side when the user chooses the right answer the background colour will change to green if they choose the wrong answer the background colour will change to red. The features will include animation, graphic and sound.  
                        </p>
       <img src="E:\website\images\idesign.jpg" alt="Interactive design" height="420" width="420">
        <p> 
            The questions will be inside a white rectangle with round edges, all of them will have an entrance effect. The background of each slide will be black and will change to green when the correct answer is selected or to red when the wrong answer is selected, when the wright answer is selected a thumbs up icon will appear on the side of the correct answer and a cheering sound will be played, same thing will happen when the wrong answer is selected a thumbs down icon will appear and a buzzer sound will play. At the bottom left there will be arrows to help the user navigate through the questions.
                </p>
        <p> 
            The hardware requirement for this multimedia is a laptop or a pc it doesn’t need to be a powerful one a cheap will do the job, the software required to play the quiz is PowerPoint or a similar software that supports the file and can open it. 
                </p>
        <p> Justification</p>
        <p>
            The design I choose for the interactive multimedia is simple and direct it will help future level 2 student pass they’re unit 1 & 2 exams with this simple quiz, the questions are clear and visible the colours are not confusing, the questions are suited for the level 2 student but anyone     can try the quiz, it fulfils the user requirements because the user will need a pc, laptop or any device than can run Microsoft PowerPoint, and use it to open the file and interact with the quiz.    
                        The design I choose for the linear multimedia is simple and it fulfils the purpose and the user requirements because the video shows some important features of the mobile app to potential buyers, like helping them convert currency and checking the cost of the items they buy      when travelling, for the user requirement they can use any device with internet enable and can play videos on the web, the video is short and display the key features of the app, the user only need to watch it they don’t need to have an advance understanding of the app.
